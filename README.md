# b-jet tagging, using deep-neural-networks
Repository containing some of the code I used in my Bachelor's thesis work. My thesis was related to b-jet tagging using deep-neural-networks. I utilized the ATLAS experiment's data for this end, and colaborated with people from CERN and LIP.
Training said networks was hard, which is why I utilized CERN's machines to do it (CERN's SWAN platform). Most of the code is stored there, but I present some examples (very basic) in the 'Example_testing' directory.
